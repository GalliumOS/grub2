Template: grub2/no_efi_extra_removable
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Skip extra installation to the EFI removable media path?
 Some EFI-based systems are buggy and do not handle new bootloaders correctly.
 If you do not make an extra installation of GRUB to the EFI removable media
 path, this may prevent your system from booting Debian correctly in case it is
 affected by this problem. However, it may remove the ability to boot any other
 operating systems that also depend on this path. If so, you will need to make
 sure that GRUB is configured successfully to be able to boot any other OS
 installations correctly.

Template: grub2/update_nvram
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Update NVRAM variables to automatically boot into Debian?
 GRUB can configure your platform's NVRAM variables so that it boots into
 Debian automatically when powered on. However, you may prefer to disable
 this behavior and avoid changes to your boot configuration. For example,
 if your NVRAM variables have been set up such that your system contacts a
 PXE server on every boot, this would preserve that behavior.

Template: grub2/device_map_regenerated
Type: note
_Description: /boot/grub/device.map has been regenerated
 The file /boot/grub/device.map has been rewritten to use stable device
 names. In most cases, this should significantly reduce the need to change
 it in future, and boot menu entries generated by GRUB should not be
 affected.
 .
 However, since more than one disk is present in the system, it is possible
 that the system is depending on the old device map. Please check whether
 there are any custom boot menu entries that rely on GRUB's (hdN) drive
 numbering, and update them if necessary.
 .
 If you do not understand this message, or if there are no custom
 boot menu entries, you can ignore this message.
